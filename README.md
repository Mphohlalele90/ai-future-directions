## 🧭 AI Development Workflow in This Project

This project follows the complete AI development workflow, as required by the PLP Academy assignment, and demonstrates best practices for real-world AI solutions:

1. **Problem Definition:**
   - The project addresses real-world challenges such as real-time image classification on edge devices (Edge AI) and smart agriculture using AI-driven IoT systems.
   - Each report and notebook begins with a clear problem statement and objectives, aligning with assignment requirements.

2. **Data Collection & Preprocessing:**
   - The Edge AI prototype uses the publicly available TensorFlow flower_photos dataset, demonstrating data acquisition, cleaning, normalization, and augmentation.
   - The smart agriculture concept discusses integrating sensor data (e.g., soil moisture, temperature) and preprocessing steps for IoT applications.

3. **Model Development:**
   - The `notebooks/edge_ai_image_classifier.ipynb` implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification, with code for data splitting, model training, and hyperparameter selection.
   - The model is optimized and converted to TensorFlow Lite for edge deployment, showcasing practical considerations for real-world use.

4. **Evaluation & Deployment:**
   - The notebook includes model evaluation using accuracy and validation metrics.
   - Deployment is demonstrated by converting the trained model to TensorFlow Lite, suitable for low-power devices.
   - The repository structure supports reproducibility and future integration.

5. **Ethical & Practical Analysis:**
   - Reports in the `reports/` directory provide critical analysis of ethical issues (e.g., bias in personalized medicine), privacy, and deployment challenges.
   - The project discusses strategies for fairness, transparency, and compliance with regulations.

6. **Futuristic & Societal Impact:**
   - The futuristic proposal explores how AI can address global challenges (e.g., water scarcity) by 2030.
   - The smart agriculture concept illustrates the societal benefits of AI-IoT integration for sustainability.

7. **Assignment Mapping:**
   - Each deliverable (notebook, report, diagram) is mapped to specific assignment sections, ensuring completeness and clarity for grading.
   - The README and code comments guide users and reviewers through the workflow and project logic.
